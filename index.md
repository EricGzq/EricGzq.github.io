At present, I am a lecturer with [Xinjiang University](https://www.xju.edu.cn/index.htm), Urumqi, China. Previously, I obtained the Ph.D. degree in Computer Science and Technology from [Hunan University](https://www.hnu.edu.cn/) in 2022. My research interests are Computer Vision and Multimedia Forensics. In particular, my current research focuses on exposing fake face images/videos generated by AI techniques.
