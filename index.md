**I would like Tech for Social Good.**

Now, I am pursuing the CS Ph.D. degree with the Hunan University, Changsha, China. My research focuses on Computer Vision and Deep Learning.

My life is like a story of the return of a prodigal son. I have a story, do you have wine?

## Mission
To make the world be better.

## Vision
To be a better man.
