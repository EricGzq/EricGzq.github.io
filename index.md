**I would like Tech for Social Good.**

Now, I am pursuing the CS Ph.D. degree with the Hunan University, Changsha, China. My research interests are Computer Vision and Deep Learning. In particular, my current research focuses on detecting fake face images/videos generated by AI techniques.

Over the years, my life is like a story of a prodigal son turning back. I have a story, do you have wine?

## Mission
To make the world be better.

## Vision
To be a better man.
