At present, I have been introduced to the [School of Computer Science and Technology](http://it.xju.edu.cn/) of [Xinjiang University](https://www.xju.edu.cn/index.htm) as an A-level Young Talent to engage in teaching and scientific research. Previously, I obtained the Ph.D. degree in Computer Science and Technology from [Hunan University](https://www.hnu.edu.cn/) in 2023. My research interests are Computer Vision and Multimedia Forensics. In particular, my current research focuses on exposing fake face images/videos generated by AI techniques.
